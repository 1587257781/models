Fault_Type,Fault_Name,Causes,Prescriptive Action
CTA,Cluster of Thermal Anamolies (CTA),"CTA Fault are the Clusters of Thermal Anomalies where ""several"" cells are warmer than rest of panel. 
It could occur: 
1. If Diodes are defective.  
2. If panel is broken","1. Shut down power to panel
2. Check panel components & diodes
3. Replace panel if required"
Diode Fault,Bypass Diode Fault,"Diode Fault are typical fault where cells of a panel in line are short-circuited.
It occurs if bypass diode are defective","1. Verify Fault by reverse current thermography
2. Replace Diodes if faulty"
FI,Faulty Interconnections (FI),"FI is Faulty Interconnections Fault where a line of panels is hotter than others.  
It occurs due to connector oxidations","1. Check Connector box, junction box
2. Replace connectors if required
3. Check individual panel for any fault"
Hot Spot,Hot Spot,"Hot spots are areas of elevated temperature affecting only part of the solar panel
It could occur:
1.If panel is broken /Dirt is accumulated                                                                                                      ","Large temperature diff Hotspot: Panel must be replaced
Small temperature diff Hotspot: Dirt cleaning process must be done for solar panel"
OHC Fault,Over Heating Components Fault (OHC Fault),"OHC Fault is Over Heating Components Fault where one module/panel is hotter than the others.
It could occur due to: 
Overheating of components in junction and connection boxes","1. Shut down power for detected panel
2. Identify Overheated Components
3. Replace /Repair it."
